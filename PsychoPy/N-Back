Numerical N-Back

This experiment uses numbers as targets to be remembered amongst numerical distractors in two conditions, a 0-back condition and a 2-back condition. 
Each condition is made up of blocks of 60 trials, with each block presented 3 times per condition. 
Block presentation is interleaved [0 back, 2 back, 0 back, 2 back, 0 back, 2, back]. 
In the 0 back condition, a target is assigned (from a range of 1-9) and presented 33 % of the time. 
In the 2 back condition, a targets are generated (from a range of 1-9) and presented 33 % of the time. 

Instructions

This is an n-back task. The n-back task presents stimuli sequentially and require you to decide if the current stimulus is the same as one presented n-numbers previous (or back).  

There are two parts, a 0-back task, and a 2-back task. 

For the 0-back you will indicate if the current number on the screen matches a defined target. 

Press SPACE if it's a target match.

For the 2-back you will indicate if the current number matches the number presented 2 places previous 
(e.g.  4 6 4 8 9 8 3 1 shows that '4' and '8' are matches in this sequence). 

Press SPACE if the current NUMBER is the same a 2 places previous.
